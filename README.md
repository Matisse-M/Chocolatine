In this project, I tried to use github actions. The CI attends some prerequisite as coding style checker (from EPITECH), compilation with Makefile, unit tests and repository mirroring.
This CI do nothing if you are already on the target repository

Evaluation: 

    Preliminaries                              2/2
    General configuration                      5/5
    Job "check_coding_style"               6.5/7.5
    Job "check_program_compilation"            6/6
    Job "run_tests"                            3/3
    Job "push_to_mirror"                   4.5/4.5
    Clear and useful names                     4/4
    Idiomatic use of GitHub Actions features   4/5
    Bonus                                       +1


/!\ This is a {EPITECH. } project do not copy this repository there's a high risk of -42 /!\
